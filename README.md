# What is CSRF? 
CSRF stands for Cross Site Request Foregery. Also known as XSRF. IT is an attack vector that tricks a web browser into executing an unwanted action in an application to which a user is logged in. CSRFs are typically conducted using malicious social engineering, such as an email or link that tricks the victim into sending a forged request to a server. As the unsuspecting user is authenticated by their application at the time of the attack, itâ€™s impossible to distinguish a legitimate request from a forged one.
